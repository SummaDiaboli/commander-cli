# Takeaways

## Issues

-   Ink is not the best solution for this. There are a lot of package resolution issues
    and some of the ink packages are wildly outdated
-   Ink's stdio implementation conflicts with the environment's leading to output being
    overwritten
-   Initial goal was to be able to run the returned command but could not pipe in user
    input for interactive commands like `npx create-next-app`
-   The prompt for returning commands sometimes fails to return a valid response as prompted

## Possible fixes

-   Rewrite in Go might be better, likely using cobra.
-   Investigate improving the prompt
-   Investigate using other AI providers
